# Product Guidelines - São Luís Garagem

## Tone and Voice
- **Friendly & Local:** The communication style should feel approachable and community-focused. It emphasizes local roots and a personalized touch, making customers feel like they are being served by a trusted neighbor rather than a faceless corporation.

## Brand Messaging
- **Transparency and Honesty:** Our core message revolves around integrity. We focus on clear pricing, direct and open communication, and the absolute absence of hidden surprises. This honesty serves as our primary differentiator from larger, more impersonal competitors.

## Visual Identity & Design Principles
- **Clean and Professional:** The user interface will be structured and easy to navigate. It utilizes a professional color palette—primarily Deep Royal Blue and Vibrant Orange (as defined in our theme)—to evoke a sense of clarity, efficiency, and trust. The layout prioritizes readability and intuitive navigation to ensure a smooth user experience.
